# Setting Up Your Repository

This guide will help you create your own GitHub repository with these ARM fixes.

## Steps to Create Repository

### 1. Initialize Git Repository

```bash
cd ~/omarchy-arm-fixes
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Omarchy ARM compatibility fixes"
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it: `omarchy-arm-fixes` (or your preferred name)
4. Add description: "ARM architecture compatibility fixes for Omarchy installation"
5. Make it public (recommended) or private
6. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 3. Connect Local Repository to GitHub

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
cd ~/omarchy-arm-fixes
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/omarchy-arm-fixes.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Update README with Your Repository URL

Edit `README.md` and replace `<your-repo-url>` with your actual repository URL:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/omarchy-arm-fixes.git ~/omarchy-arm-fixes
```

Then commit the change:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README with repository URL"
git push
```

## Repository Structure

Your repository should now contain:

```
omarchy-arm-fixes/
├── README.md                    # Main documentation
├── TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md         # Detailed technical analysis
├── SETUP_REPOSITORY.md         # This file
├── install-omarchy-arm.sh      # Automated installation script
├── apply-arm-fixes.sh          # Manual patch application script
├── patches/                    # Patch files directory
│   ├── packages.patch          # Package compatibility fixes
│   ├── webapp-launcher.patch   # Web app launcher fixes  
│   ├── mimetypes.patch         # MIME type configuration fixes

            ├── zoom.conf       # Missing Zoom configuration
            └── 1password.conf  # Fixed 1Password configuration
```

## Using Your Repository

Once your repository is set up, you or others can install Omarchy on ARM systems using:

```bash
# Fresh installation
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/omarchy-arm-fixes.git ~/omarchy-arm-fixes
cd ~/omarchy-arm-fixes
./install-omarchy-arm.sh
```

Or apply fixes to existing installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/omarchy-arm-fixes.git ~/omarchy-arm-fixes
cd ~/omarchy-arm-fixes
./apply-arm-fixes.sh ~/.local/share/omarchy
```

## Sharing and Contributing

### For Users
Share your repository URL with other ARM users who need these fixes.

### For Contributors
1. Fork your repository
2. Create feature branches for improvements
3. Submit pull requests with detailed descriptions
4. Test all changes on ARM hardware

## Maintenance

Keep your repository updated by:

1. **Monitoring Omarchy updates** - Check if upstream changes break the fixes
2. **Testing new ARM packages** - Some previously unavailable packages may become available
3. **Updating documentation** - Keep technical details current
4. **Collecting user feedback** - Track issues reported by users

## License

Consider adding a license file. Since this builds on Omarchy, use a compatible license. Create `LICENSE` file with appropriate content.

```bash
cat > LICENSE << 'EOF'
